# Daily Hockey Digest

The TL;DR here is that I have a betting strategy around NHL hockey and I want to have all the stats I want easily accessible to me without having to Google "nhl today" every day. This tool is built to run as a scheduled cron job, every morning, update the data, and then create a forecast for today;s games and mail them straight to my inbox.
