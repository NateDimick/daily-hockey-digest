# Machine Learning - Data Collection

inside this folder I will use APIs available to me to collect data about NHL games in previous seasons to use for testing and training a model.

[documentation on the NHL's public-ish api](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/tree/master)

the goal here is to just store raw requests. trying to process immediately after making a request can lead to unexpected errors and then you have to re-collect data or edit scripts on the fly and that's just nasty.
